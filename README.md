### Warning, this is a deprecated role

It has been superseded by [debops.authorized_keys](https://github.com/debops/ansible-authorized_keys).

***

`debops.sshkeys` role can be used to manage users SSH keys in
`/etc/ssh/authorized_keys/` directory. This role is required for SFTPonly
accounts created by `debops.sftpusers` role to disallow access to
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for users themselves.


### Role dependencies

- `debops.secret`

### Are you using this as a standalone role without DebOps?

You may need to include missing roles from the [DebOps common
playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml)
into your playbook.
